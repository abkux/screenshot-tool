# screenshot-tool

My custom screenshot tool lets me rename the screenshot image 🖼️, upload it to my private server, and automatically copy the link to my clipboard 🔗 .

# How to run?

```
git clone https://github.com/abkux/screenshot-tool.git

npm install
```

- Make changes in **.env ** ( GKEY and SERVER_URL )
- ```
  node index.js
  ```

If you don't want to use upload-server thing you can just comment those line of code.
